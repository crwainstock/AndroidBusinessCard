# 👩🏻‍💼 Android Business Card

This is one of my first Android app builds (yay!!). I built it as a part of the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) course.

## 🛠️ Technologies

This little Android app was built using Android Studio. Prior to this build, I went through the Android Basics with Compose lessons and learned about building basic layouts in Android Studio with Compose.

This app uses a column structure to organize the content on the screen. There are two composable elements: the image/name/job title and the contact info section. The main image was provided by the course, but the icons were added by me with the help of the [Vector Asset Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio#svg).
